# Cavern Money Market Contracts
A Rust and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) implementation of the Cavern Protocol money market on the [Terra blockchain](https://terra.money).

You can find information about the architecture, usage, and function of the smart contracts in the [documentation](https://docs.cavernprotocol.com/).

### Dependencies

Money Market has dependencies on [aAsset Contracts](https://github.com/CavernPerson/cavern-aAsset-contracts).

## Development

### Environment Setup

- Rust v1.44.1+
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Docker

1. Install `rustup` via https://rustup.rs/

2. Run the following:

```sh
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed.

### Unit / Integration Tests

Each contract contains Rust unit and integration tests embedded within the contract source directories. You can run:

```sh
cargo unit-test
cargo integration-test
```

### Compiling

After making sure tests pass, you can compile each contract with the following:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw1_subkeys.wasm .
ls -l cw1_subkeys.wasm
sha256sum cw1_subkeys.wasm
```

#### Production

For production builds, run the following:

```sh
./build.sh
```

This performs several optimizations which can significantly reduce the final size of the contract binaries, which will be available inside the `artifacts/` directory.
